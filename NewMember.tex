    \section*{\centering Welcome to i3Detroit!}
\noindent
As a community-run organization, we place a lot of trust in each other, and we all help keep things running around here. There's a lot to learn, and this page is meant as a guide. Hang on to it.

\noindent
Here are some very knowledgeable members who would love to help you get started. Call or email any of us with questions. We were all new, once...

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Nate Bezanson, 248-379-3614, \href{mailto:myself@telcodata.us}{myself@telcodata.us}
        \item Maddy Winans, 248-821-0798, \href{mailto:madalyn.winans@gmail.com}{madalyn.winans@gmail.com}
        \item Matt Oehrlein, 651-261-9747, \href{mailto:matt@i3detroit.com}{matt@i3detroit.com}
        \item Your mentor, see other side of this page...
    \end{enumerate}

\noindent
As a new member:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Please accept all the Google Groups invitations in your email -- this is our primary communication method. If you didn't get them, email \href{mailto:contact@i3detroit.com}{contact@i3detroit.com}! (Check your spam box...)
        \item Go to \url{http://groups.google.com/group/i3detroit} and post a ``Hi I'm new'' message. If you're unable to log in, get in touch with your mentor, or email \href{mailto:contact@i3detroit.com}{contact@i3detroit.com}.
        \item If you don't know how to use a tool, feel free to post to the group above, asking to learn. Someone will be happy to set up a time to teach you, but you have to ask! Be bold!
        \item There's a box of T-shirts under the front counter. Want one? Slip ten bucks in an envelope, write ``T-shirt'' on it, and slip it into the dues drop-box. (The cup in the fridge can usually make change.)
        \item There's a tremendous amount of information collected in the Wiki. Find it at \url{http://www.i3detroit.com/wiki}. Try searching for the name of any tool, for instance.
        \item If you see something that needs fixing, bring it up and help fix it. If you see someone doing something unsafe, speak up and help them do it safely. If you need help, ask for it.
        \item You have the same rights and responsibilities as every other member, new or ``seasoned''.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Some of those rights:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Give tours, interviews, and stuff.
                    \item Use every tool you've been checked out on. Check with the owner, listed on the wiki.
                    \item Get involved at meetings and via email, and help shape the community.
                    \item Host guests, hold events, and share your own interests with the group.
                    \item Have your projects featured on the i3detroit.com front page blog. Ask how!
                \end{itemize}
                \item Some of those responsibilities:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Take out the trash when it's full. You're now one of dozens of part-time janitors!
                    \item Uphold the group's spirit and image, especially on \href{mailto:i3detroit-public@googlegroups.com}{i3detroit-public@googlegroups.com}.
                    \item Help your fellow members keep after our various messes.
                    \item Make sure every guest signs a waiver and gets signed in by a member, perhaps you.
                    \item If you just took the last copy of this page, find the original on the wiki and print more.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \item When talking about i3Detroit, remember to say ``we''. You're one of us now, welcome!
    \end{itemize}
